# Observing the Sands of Time - The Last of Us

Fun little project I put together to display a slideshow of images with a single overlay using a mouse hover to observe before/after effects of Naughty Dog's talented artists' rendition of the zombie apocalypse throughout the world.

### Tools/utilities used to put this together
* Lookingglass.js - https://github.com/mikesizz/lookingglass
* jQuery Slider - https://github.com/jssor/jquery-slider

I'm still working on this, so if you happen to see this repo while this message is still up, I'm not done yet.
